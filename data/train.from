The same is also true for Centaur Warrunner. You can build evasion on him and be even harder to kill while still proccing Return damage!
Haha oh god this is the best thread I've seen all day
Awesome, we get to have another HarBo....oh.
No doxie doughnut?
I know a guy that's into model trains. He scores more pussy than anyone I know and I don't think the trains have anything to do with it.
Thanks for the link. If it's semi open, does that mean companies can manufacture their own x86 CPUs?
Weird really as one would've thought the rational evidence/common sense angle on legalisation would be right up UKIP's street.
From my experience pushing carts most of those were probably left there by other handicapped people.
Yeah, No. She left the conversation 5 minutes later.
You do know that you can release the poor mouse sometimes and type with both hands? It's really faster! ;)
Still negative ROI.

I found that just softly gazing at the red letter made it easy to just 'accept' the words, rather than actually reading it. 
Man, I miss living alone.
Felt the exact same way, I turned it off a couple of times. Some of the stuff was just corny as hell.

I'm interested! Possibly even a nude shoot. 
Don't use up/down stairs. They cause collisions. Instead use up stairs and down stairs.

Well it appears you have a damp house. No mushrooms in my house, which is not damp. Get a dehumidifier or a space heater or something.

Yeah thanks, it seems that either iTunes can't handle the traffic or something's happening with the store updating, so a lot of people are having trouble with the links.
Nobody post the 'penguin of d00m' copypasta, please.
Literally any other player on the pitch. Gerrard isn't starting because he's the only guy who knows how to take a penalty.
Dude. That's the entire NFC South.
Because of the misrepresentation of the rules?
Lmao
But Lederhosen is a men's outfit, when do women ever wear it?
It's simple. He doesn't and you're exaggerating. If you can't beat a bronze squad when you have the likes of Pirlo then you're pish.
I just couldn't resist posting it!
And we're meta
The level of intelligent thinking that you're presuming I had at that moment is far, far too high. 
Quite possibly. My grandad's diabetes cost him several toes before it took his life too :(

I should mention that I am in Canada and they were Hawkins Cheezies so I'd say the jaw workout was at least similar. They are extremely crunchy.

We're all tied up lads! One more win for us and a loss for the blues gives us the top of the table!

Dude, Cumberbatch looks like he's halfway through animorphing into a gecko and I'd still give him my credit card information if he asked me nicely with a soft voice.
The country that really misses out is Britain. We conquered the world through naval dominance, you certainly couldn't do that in EU4.
It should be. Szczesny was awful. He should lose his spot as he effectively lost the game on his own. 
You're right. Symbian is a mobile operating system
YES
Hmmm, I may have repressed that memory, because I agree with you on that point. Then again, I never liked Lisa, so I was glad when she went missing.
Its because the heisman has turned into QB of the best team award

Another example of the failure that is the war on (some) drugs.

Why even make soap when magma is the best disinfectant?
Yes, but 'inshallah' is commonly used when referring to something that is supposed to happen. For example: 'ok, I'll see you tomorrow, inshallah.'
I'm still not sure.
This thread has me confused. The vote totals seem off.

Uh... no. Just napping. 
I wear female version of Lederhosen because I prefer them over Dirndls.They're much shorter and tighter. I can attach a pic if you would like.
Not if you're the one fooling around at the back, trying to get some action, only to find that you look like an idiot now.
Props to anyone who can deliver the line 'Turning now to what we expect the chunder bell curve to look like' with that much deadpan.
Same with Far Cry 2 to Far Cry 3. Huge improvement.
Have you tried looking people in the eyes yet? Give that a try. 
'Draco' is the Latin word for 'dragon.'It's also the origin of some dragon-related English words.

Maybe once they noticed the video going viral, they put a commercial link in the video's description, which immediately triggered Youtube's radars.
Do they actually like white straight sane women or not? I can never really tell?
Hehehe ... Waldeau, a name that would make Walder Frey proud.
I wish I was a baller? Wait, that can't be right.

I thought he had more potential than Westbrook. I'm not sure if I was right or wrong. 
No. A family member shared it and said 'Amen'.
I think you mean best time line because we got the people coconut shrimp. 
But seriously, what about for nuclear purposes? ;)
Thanks! You also make a good point, I doubt it would work if I sent it to a larger organization with more general counsel.
I think Sandor would win 7/10 against Gregor in single combat
pffft, your talking crap, Abel wins you the run!
This could be a show on Fox.

I think some things should be private, and some things should be national. Natural monopolies, like rail, should be nationally owned.
Can you imagine how much people would rage if Origin or Uplay had all the problems that Steam has on a regular basis?

I'm on it like 10 hours a day. So my life has been 'wasted' and I'm fine with it. 
Mostly human stats, but strength was nerfed to 4. Speed was nerfed too, among other things. There were also some bonuses though, like reduced fall damage.
-.-, i think i should start paticipating in these 'secret Santa' rounds. Dis so cuute! :3
Nope. The promo where X Pac came back was the same promo where HHH 'kicked out' Shawn, saying he dropped the ball. NAO joined later that night.
Come on bro. You needed to hold up a piece of paper that said 'raphi809' in those pictures for verification.
Thanks for doing this. I didn't think you would put so much work into it!
Google maps is pretty close with this. Most major malls have an inside map to view of all the stores and their locations inside. 
This is the same woman who giggles every time someone mentions the term 'special teams'
That's fair. Hopefully California is similar. I have some traveling to do this year, so I want that taken care of.
I for one actually like the ending and consider it among some of my favorites, don't worry about it, enjoy the show, it is excellent!
I'd pay to watch you watch him punch Justin Bieber.
People probably wouldn't care, but it does look a little suspicious with how many reposts you made.

Why would he do that? Cause its not about professional bodybuilding? He needs to understand the users decide the content of a sub. Hope you saved it.
Well, they did that too. Some scenes are mostly CG and some are live action.

Can you say where you have lived and worked in the US?  I don't doubt what you say.  Some Americans believe Russian=Communist=Evil.

The whole debate is admittedly inane.
This seems ordinary. 
What are you talking about, that's his o-face. 
Dying in ones sleep seems to me that best way to go. That was awfully nice of him to wish you a peaceful transition when your time is up.
Thanks all!Out of interest, what is your favourite 'view' of the games library? Do you use the detail view much?
Genuinely thought he would retire with Liverpool, quite shocked by this.
It's not like we're not overspending nowadays.
It's the right amount of sentimental without being cheesy, this would've been a wonderful end.

What if I learn chinese?
Oh god I have to do something today? ugh...I think I might just sow directly into the soil out of laziness lol
One thing to note about Manjula is she is a vegetarian. While there are TONS of amazing vegetarian dishes, she really pares down the possibilities.

Wait until she teleports into the enchanting table you were using and keeps asking you that for as long as you're using it.
I laughed, and now I'm confused.  What is funny?
'Honey, I'll be in my *workshop*.'
Seriously. She's probably told people for years, but no one believed her or something. And if he had any siblings, it was the same thing.
Same one I kept getting added by. Would love a report option on friend request...
Yeah.. but now i'm sad. 
Naw.

Nah he is just an emo liverpool fan.
Upon request I deleted my original post and blurred the pizza man's face out as well

I jus like to think he's cheering because Homer is. You don't spontaneously cheer when others do?
Personally, I think the fight should be called off for Jones' safety and well being. Who knows what kind of deadly techniques the honorable Sensei Seagal has taught DC.

No it was homo. It's alright though. 
And Vol. 2 or 2001 or even Doggystyle weren't?
