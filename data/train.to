This really showed me Tom Hardy's acting breadth. He was so understated and disarming. I had only recently watched him in 'Bronson' delivering another out of the park performance. 
So many players play the same, but the thing that makes Yaya special is he is so different to watch, its amazing.

I find that the best jokes usually involve both of those things.
It's a yeast-based product, it tastes vaguely of beef base.
It's barely even noticeable though, and it doesn't even make much sense. You aren't pillaging if you annex a city immediately, so you shouldn't get gold for it. 
The animation doesn't represent how quickly or how they think a fight would go. It's just there to showcase the two fighters' abilities and the outcome
My cat said I should broccoli you.

Pretty much along those lines! I haven't been that sick in a looong time.
I've managed to use my scales for more than weighing trees quite often. Cooking, shipping, hobbycraft. It's very handy!
Mostly human stats, but strength was nerfed to 4. Speed was nerfed too, among other things. There were also some bonuses though, like reduced fall damage.

I used to like him but now hes pissing me off. And /u/weakprivilege and some others.
Most of the scenes are CG. The raccoon turned out to be a total diva and they fires him early on in filming.
People rarely use All-Star games if they're serious about comparing players and not their legacies. We know how they work.

Oh, sweet! I love the banner. :)
That's it, thank you.
Not saying also that had some frauds with donations, some artist had their show canceled by last hour and many 'invisible' admins. Encyclopedia Dramatica has an article about Dashcon 
Everyone is just Brian Blessed in another suit of armour. There's your movie. 
Dat singing episode was not a good choice. Amazing show tho.

On the other hand it is only the second time he's conceded that many goals (as far as I'm aware). Make of that what you will.
By that logic, the European Powers weren't imperialistic in Africa because it was the Scramble for Africa. Or maybe they were just spreading enlightenment.
It's got a space for where your finger doesn't go...
At least, quite literally 99 percent of the time anyway.
Yeah, that was the point. Thin privilege is attainable by anyone and not an actual advantage in life, just subjective things or things that don't actually matter in life
Ouch.

he's been brilliant this year in Halt and Catch Fire. quality actor.
I honestly thought Far Cry 3 looked way better than 2. Far Cry 2 was all brown and muddy, whereas 3 had really vibrant colours.
Apparently this is actually a factually correct statement (or at least was at the time the show was airing).

He looks like Paul Giamatti in American Splendor.
Its just too bad he didnt wait for me to say thank you back to him. you never know i might end up Vs him again.
I only use the detail view.
Really? I'm not. I think the MLS is the new 'soft' retirement for EPL players. It's like a victory lap that doesn't really count. 
well at least we have some time now to save money.
Indeed. That's wonderful. Still on season 1, but the show will end that way for me regardless of the end they provide.
